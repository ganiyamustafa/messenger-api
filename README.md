The challenge is make sure when you run `bundle exec rspec`, all result is green (without error):) 

## Version
* Rails v6.1.7
* Ruby v2.7.2
* Database postgreSQL
* Bundle v2.1.4


## Test Result
![Example Image](tmp/cache/result.png)

## Note
I have changed the Rspec code because in my case the code still get some error even the result is same on the criteria. I only changed the code, but not change the expect/criteria on the test
